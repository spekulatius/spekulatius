### Hi there 👋

I'm Peter, a developer, entrepreneur, and writer. 🔭 

👷️ These days, I'm working mostly with [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) and [VueJS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)/[Alpine](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine). 

🏗️ I'm building [PHPScraper](https://github.com/spekulatius/phpscraper), [Commonmark Blog](https://github.com/spekulatius/laravel-commonmark-blog) and a few indie projects. 

📈️ I'm also excited about [SEO and ranking](https://github.com/Awesome-SEO) too.

💬 You can find most of my words on my [dev blog](https://releasecandidate.dev) and my [business blog](https://peterthaleikis.com). 

More to come soon!
