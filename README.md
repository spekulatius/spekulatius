### Hi there 👋

I'm Peter, a developer with a passion for open source & InfoSec! 😎 I'm a fan of Linux, Bash and Tool builder 💻

🧰 I'm inspired by great tool makers such as [Tomnomnom](https://github.com/tomnomnom). If you are keen to follow [my tools](https://github.com/spekulatius?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=), please star your favourites and follow me 🌟

👷️ When it comes to developing web-apps, [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) with [Livewire](https://github.com/livewire/livewire) and [Filament](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament) are my stack ✨️🤩️

💬 You can find my writing on my [dev blog](https://releasecandidate.dev) and my [general blog](https://peterthaleikis.com).
