### Hi there 👋

I'm Peter, a developer, entrepreneur, and writer. 🔭 

👷️ [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) and [Livewire](https://github.com/livewire/livewire), [VueJS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)/[Alpine](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) are ✨️

🏗️ I love building stuff. At the moment I'm working on [PHPScraper](https://github.com/spekulatius/phpscraper) and the [Commonmark Blog for Laravel](https://github.com/spekulatius/laravel-commonmark-blog). I'm also contributing to open-source projects such as [PuPHPeteer](https://github.com/rialto-php/puphpeteer) and [Spatie's Crawler](https://github.com/spatie/crawler) 🤩️

📈️ I'm also excited about [SEO and ranking](https://github.com/Awesome-SEO). Lots of interesting data and effects to research 👨‍🎓️

💬 You can find most of my words on my [dev blog](https://releasecandidate.dev) and my [business blog](https://peterthaleikis.com). 

More to come soon!
