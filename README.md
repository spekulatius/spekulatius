### Hi there 👋

I'm Peter, a developer with a passion for open source & InfoSec! 😎 I'm a fan of Linux and like building tools 💻

🧰 Great developers & security researchers like [Tom Hudson (tomnomnom)](https://github.com/tomnomnom) and [Johan Carlsson (joaxcar)](https://hackerone.com/joaxcar?type=user) inspire me. If you are keen you can check [my tools & open-source projects](https://github.com/spekulatius?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=) too.

👷️ When it comes to developing web-apps, [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) with [Livewire](https://github.com/livewire/livewire) and [Filament](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament) are my stack ✨️🤩️

💬 You can find my writing on my [dev blog](https://releasecandidate.dev) and my [general blog](https://peterthaleikis.com). 

More to come soon!
